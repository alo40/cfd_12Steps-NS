# cfd_12Steps-NS
I follow the tutorial https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/ only with some cool animation from my part, nothing new here :)

The python version used is the 3.7.6 and not compatible with python2.

From Step07 you need to place your python working directory on the same path as the used file. The reason is that I created a separate .py file with all the functions needed and still don't know how to call it from a different path ... :/
